## FHIR fuel

Place to prepare proposals to FHIR standard
about JSON, JSON-schema, Swagger/OpenAPI integration, native JSON databases
and other JSON-like formats (yaml, avro, edn).


## TODO

* Use issues to start discussion of relevant ideas.
* We could dump some consensus into repository as some artifacts.
* Informal rules could be formulated in wiki.
* Create stream in https://chat.fhir.org (integrate github)
* Live discussions using youtube/hangout
